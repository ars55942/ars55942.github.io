<h1> Hi there!</h1>
<h2> My name is Andrew Sorrells and this is MY web page!</h2>
<h4> About Me: </h4>
<p>
	I am a sophomore at the greatest university in the world (<em>Go Dawgs!</em>) and I am studying accounting.
	I'm from the small town of Carrollton, Georgia, where I've lived in the same house for the first 18 and a half years of my life.
	I have a pretty typical family: my sister, my dad, and my stepmother. I also have a few stepbrothers and a stepsister as well.
	I grew up playing as many sports as I could, and still am very active in sports today. Such sports include, but is not limited to:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li> flag football</li>
	<li> basketball </li>
	<li> volleyball </li>
	<li> softball </li>
	<li> spikeball </li>
	<li> ultimate frisbee </li>
</ul>

<h4> What I Am Involved In:</h4>	
<p>
	Most of these sports I play are in intramural sports or with my fraternity brothers.
	I am also involved in <a href="https://www.betaupsilonchi.org/"><i>Beta Upsilon Chi</i></a>, or BYX for short (also pronounced '<strong>Bucks</strong>'), which is a Christian
	fraternity here on campus. We have a fairly large organization of about 70 brothers, and we strive
	to branch out into Greek life and to spread Jesus through our socials, date nights, and events with other Greek organizations.
	I am also involved with Wesley, an on-campus ministry, as well as working at Cali 'n' Tito's in Eastside.
</p>
<h4> What I Plan To Do:</h4>
<p>
	The future is an incredible place. It has no limits except what you put on it.
	You could become the next president (because let's be honest, if Hillary and Trump are our candididates, anyone can do it)
	or you could become a CEO of the next big thing. My plan is to live a mixture of extravagantly, yet simply.
	To live life to the fullest, yet not overload myself with worries and responsibilities.
